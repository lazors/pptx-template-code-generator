  # Split View Slide Creator

  This is a code bundle for Split View Slide Creator. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/AvyDikvz6log6PZgCivR0Y/Split-View-Slide-Creator.

  ## Running the code

  Install dependencies with pnpm (recommended):

  ```
  corepack enable             # enable Corepack (Node 16+)
  corepack prepare pnpm@8.8.0 --activate
  pnpm install
  ```

  Or, if you prefer a global install:

  ```
  npm i -g pnpm
  pnpm install
  If you previously used npm and have a `package-lock.json`, you can import it:

  ```
  pnpm import
  ```

  This will create a `pnpm-lock.yaml` for reproducible installs.
  ```

  Run the development server with pnpm:

  ```
  pnpm run dev
  ```
